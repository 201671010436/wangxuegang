First Flight
　　Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents, so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane, Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally, however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe, and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.
　　His friend started the engine and began to taxi onto the runway of the airport. Mr. Johnson had heard that the most dangerous part of a flight were the take-off and the landing, so he was extremely frightened and closed his eyes.
　　After a minute or two he opened them again, looked out of the window of the plane, and said to his friend, "Look at those people down there. They look as small as ants, don't they?"
　　"Those are ants," answered his friend. "We're still on the ground."A Nail Or A Fly?
　　An old gentleman whose eyesight was failing came to stay in a hotel room with a bottle of wine in each hand. On the wall there was a fly which he took for a nail. So the moment he hung them on, the bottles fell broken and the wine spilt all over the floor. When a waitress discovered what had happened, she showed deep sympathy for him and decided to do him a favour.
　　So the next morning when he was out taking a walk in the roof garden, she hammered a nail exactly where the fly had stayed.
　　Now the old man entered his room. The smell of the spilt wine reminded him of the accident. When he looked up at the wall, he found the fly was there again! He walked to it carefully adn slapped it with all his strength. On hearing a loud cry, the kind-hearted waitress rushed in. To her great surprise, the poor old man was there sitting on the floor, his teeth clenched and his right hand bleeding!
Chaude and Cold
　　A patron in Montreal cafe turned on a tap in the washroom and got scalded. "This is an outrage," he complained. "The faucet marked C gave me boiling water."
　　"But, Monsieur, C stands for chaude - French for hot. You should know that if you live in Montreal."
　　"Wait a minute," roared the patron. "The other tap is also marked C."
　　"Of course," said the manager, "It stands for cold. After all, Montreal is a bilingual city."Imitate Birds
　　A man tried to get a job in a stage show. "What can you do?" asked the producer.
　　"Imitate birds," the man said.
　　"Are you kidding?" answered the producer, "People like that are a dime a dozen."
　　"Well, I guess that's that." said the actor, as he spread his arms and flew out the window.How Did You Ever Get Here
　　One winter morning, an employee explained why he had shown up for work 45 minutes late. "It was so slippery out that for every step I took ahead, I slipped back two."
　　The boss eyed him suspiciously. "Oh, yeah? Then how did you ever get here?"
　　"I finally gave up," he said, "and started for home."　Keep the Change
　　Selling secondhand books at our church bazaar, I got into an argument with a prospective customer. He was interested in buying The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash but claimed it was overpriced at 35 cents. Other paperbacks were selling for ten or 15 cents each.
　　I pointed out that the book was in good condition. Nash was a fun poet, and it was for a good cause. He said it was a matter of principle. Ultimately, I agreed to sell him the book for 15 cents. Triumphant, he paid with a $10 bill. "Keep the change," he said.Midway Tactics
　　Three competing store owners rented adjoining shops in a mall. Observers waited for mayhem to ensue.
　　The retailer on the right put up huge signs saying, "Gigantic Sale!" and "Super Bargains!"
　　The store on the left raised bigger signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"
　　The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".Best Reward
　　A naval officer fell overboard. He was rescued by a deck hand. The officer asked how he could reward him.
　　"The best way, sir," said the deck hand, "is to say nothing about it. If the other fellows knew I'd pulled you out, they'd chuck me in."A Mistake
　　An Amercian, a Scot and a Canadian were killed in a car accident. They arrived at the gates of heaven, where a flustered St. Peterexplained that there had been a mistake. "Give me $500 each," he said, "and I'll return you to earth as if the whole thing never happened."
　　"Done!" said the American. Instantly, he found himself standing unhurt near the scene.
　　"Where are the others?" asked a medic.First Flight

　　"Those are ants," answered his friend. "We're still on the ground."A Nail Or A Fly?
　　An old gentleman whose eyesight was failing came to stay in a hotel room with a bottle of wine in each hand. On the wall there was a fly which he took for a nail. So the moment he hung them on, the bottles fell broken and the wine spilt all over the floor. When a waitress discovered what had happened, she showed deep sympathy for him and decided to do him a favour.
　　So the next morning when he was out taking a walk in the roof garden, she hammered a nail exactly where the fly had stayed.
　　Now the old man entered his room. The smell of the spilt wine reminded him of the accident. When he looked up at the wall, he found the fly was there again! He walked to it carefully adn slapped it with all his strength. On hearing a loud cry, the kind-hearted waitress rushed in. To her great surprise, the poor old man was there sitting on the floor, his teeth clenched and his right hand bleeding!
Chaude and Cold
　　A patron in Montreal cafe turned on a tap in the washroom and got scalded. "This is an outrage," he complained. "The faucet marked C gave me boiling water."
　　"But, Monsieur, C stands for chaude - French for hot. You should know that if you live in Montreal."
　　"Wait a minute," roared the patron. "The other tap is also marked C."
　　"Of course," said the manager, "It stands for cold. After all, Montreal is a bilingual city."Imitate Birds
　　A man tried to get a job in a stage show. "What can you do?" asked the producer.
　　"Imitate birds," the man said.
　　"Are you kidding?" answered the producer, "People like that are a dime a dozen."
　　"Well, I guess that's that." said the actor, as he spread his arms and flew out the window.How Did You Ever Get Here
　　One winter morning, an employee explained why he had shown up for work 45 minutes late. "It was so slippery out that for every step I took ahead, I slipped back two."
　　The boss eyed him suspiciously. "Oh, yeah? Then how did you ever get here?"
　　"I finally gave up," he said, "and started for home."　Keep the Change
　　Selling secondhand books at our church bazaar, I got into an argument with a prospective customer. He was interested in buying The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash but claimed it was overpriced at 35 cents. Other paperbacks were selling for ten or 15 cents each.
　　I pointed out that the book was in good condition. Nash was a fun poet, and it was for a good cause. He said it was a matter of principle. Ultimately, I agreed to sell him the book for 15 cents. Triumphant, he paid with a $10 bill. "Keep the change," he said.Midway Tactics
　　Three competing store owners rented adjoining shops in a mall. Observers waited for mayhem to ensue.
　　The retailer on the right put up huge signs saying, "Gigantic Sale!" and "Super Bargains!"
　　The store on the left raised bigger signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"
　　The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".Best Reward
　　A naval officer fell overboard. He was rescued by a deck hand. The officer asked how he could reward him.
　　"The best way, sir," said the deck hand, "is to say nothing about it. If the other fellows knew I'd pulled you out, they'd chuck me in."A Mistake
　　An Amercian, a Scot and a Canadian were killed in a car accident. They arrived at the gates of heaven, where a flustered St. Peterexplained that there had been a mistake. "Give me $500 each," he said, "and I'll return you to earth as if the whole thing never happened."
　　"Done!" said the American. Instantly, he found himself standing unhurt near the scene.
　　"Where are the others?" asked a medic.First Flight
　　Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents, so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane, Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally, however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe, and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.

So the moment he hung them on, the bottles fell broken and the wine spilt all over the floor. When a waitress discovered what had happened, she showed deep sympathy for him and decided to do him a favour.
　　So the next morning when he was out taking a walk in the roof garden, she hammered a nail exactly where the fly had stayed.
　　Now the old man entered his room. The smell of the spilt wine reminded him of the accident. When he looked up at the wall, he found the fly was there again! He walked to it carefully adn slapped it with all his strength. On hearing a loud cry, the kind-hearted waitress rushed in. To her great surprise, the poor old man was there sitting on the floor, his teeth clenched and his right hand bleeding!
Chaude and Cold
　　A patron in Montreal cafe turned on a tap in the washroom and got scalded. "This is an outrage," he complained. "The faucet marked C gave me boiling water."
　　"But, Monsieur, C stands for chaude - French for hot. You should know that if you live in Montreal."
　　"Wait a minute," roared the patron. "The other tap is also marked C."
　　"Of course," said the manager, "It stands for cold. After all, Montreal is a bilingual city."Imitate Birds
　　A man tried to get a job in a stage show. "What can you do?" asked the producer.
　　"Imitate birds," the man said.
　　"Are you kidding?" answered the producer, "People like that are a dime a dozen."
　　"Well, I guess that's that." said the actor, as he spread his arms and flew out the window.How Did You Ever Get Here
　　One winter morning, an employee explained why he had shown up for work 45 minutes late. "It was so slippery out that for every step I took ahead, I slipped back two."
　　The boss eyed him suspiciously. "Oh, yeah? Then how did you ever get here?"
　　"I finally gave up," he said, "and started for home."　Keep the Change
　　Selling secondhand books at our church bazaar, I got into an argument with a prospective customer. He was interested in buying The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash but claimed it was overpriced at 35 cents. Other paperbacks were selling for ten or 15 cents each.
　　I pointed out that the book was in good condition. Nash was a fun poet, and it was for a good cause. He said it was a matter of principle. Ultimately, I agreed to sell him the book for 15 cents. Triumphant, he paid with a $10 bill. "Keep the change," he said.Midway Tactics
　　Three competing store owners rented adjoining shops in a mall. Observers waited for mayhem to ensue.
　　The retailer on the right put up huge signs saying, "Gigantic Sale!" and "Super Bargains!"
　　The store on the left raised bigger signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"
　　The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".Best Reward
　　A naval officer fell overboard. He was rescued by a deck hand. The officer asked how he could reward him.
　　"The best way, sir," said the deck hand, "is to say nothing about it. If the other fellows knew I'd pulled you out, they'd chuck me in."A Mistake
　　An Amercian, a Scot and a Canadian were killed in a car accident. They arrived at the gates of heaven, where a flustered St. Peterexplained that there had been a mistake. "Give me $500 each," he said, "and I'll return you to earth as if the whole thing never happened."
　　"Done!" said the American. Instantly, he found himself standing unhurt near the scene.
　　"Where are the others?" asked a medic.First Flight
　　Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents, so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane, Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally, however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe, and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.
　　His friend started the engine and began to taxi onto the runway of the airport. Mr. Johnson had heard that the most dangerous part of a flight were the take-off and the landing, so he was extremely frightened and closed his eyes.
　　After a minute or two he opened them again, looked out of the window of the plane, and said to his friend, "Look at those people down there. They look as small as ants, don't they?"
　　"Those are ants," answered his friend. "We're still on the ground."A Nail Or A Fly?

He walked to it carefully adn slapped it with all his strength. On hearing a loud cry, the kind-hearted waitress rushed in. To her great surprise, the poor old man was there sitting on the floor, his teeth clenched and his right hand bleeding!
Chaude and Cold
　　A patron in Montreal cafe turned on a tap in the washroom and got scalded. "This is an outrage," he complained. "The faucet marked C gave me boiling water."
　　"But, Monsieur, C stands for chaude - French for hot. You should know that if you live in Montreal."
　　"Wait a minute," roared the patron. "The other tap is also marked C."
　　"Of course," said the manager, "It stands for cold. After all, Montreal is a bilingual city."Imitate Birds
　　A man tried to get a job in a stage show. "What can you do?" asked the producer.
　　"Imitate birds," the man said.
　　"Are you kidding?" answered the producer, "People like that are a dime a dozen."
　　"Well, I guess that's that." said the actor, as he spread his arms and flew out the window.How Did You Ever Get Here
　　One winter morning, an employee explained why he had shown up for work 45 minutes late. "It was so slippery out that for every step I took ahead, I slipped back two."
　　The boss eyed him suspiciously. "Oh, yeah? Then how did you ever get here?"
　　"I finally gave up," he said, "and started for home."　Keep the Change
　　Selling secondhand books at our church bazaar, I got into an argument with a prospective customer. He was interested in buying The Pocket Book of Ogden Nash but claimed it was overpriced at 35 cents. Other paperbacks were selling for ten or 15 cents each.
　　I pointed out that the book was in good condition. Nash was a fun poet, and it was for a good cause. He said it was a matter of principle. Ultimately, I agreed to sell him the book for 15 cents. Triumphant, he paid with a $10 bill. "Keep the change," he said.Midway Tactics
　　Three competing store owners rented adjoining shops in a mall. Observers waited for mayhem to ensue.
　　The retailer on the right put up huge signs saying, "Gigantic Sale!" and "Super Bargains!"
　　The store on the left raised bigger signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"
　　The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".Best Reward
　　A naval officer fell overboard. He was rescued by a deck hand. The officer asked how he could reward him.
　　"The best way, sir," said the deck hand, "is to say nothing about it. If the other fellows knew I'd pulled you out, they'd chuck me in."A Mistake
　　An Amercian, a Scot and a Canadian were killed in a car accident. They arrived at the gates of heaven, where a flustered St. Peterexplained that there had been a mistake. "Give me $500 each," he said, "and I'll return you to earth as if the whole thing never happened."
　　"Done!" said the American. Instantly, he found himself standing unhurt near the scene.
　　"Where are the others?" asked a medic.First Flight
　　Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents, so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane, Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally, however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe, and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.
　　His friend started the engine and began to taxi onto the runway of the airport. Mr. Johnson had heard that the most dangerous part of a flight were the take-off and the landing, so he was extremely frightened and closed his eyes.
　　After a minute or two he opened them again, looked out of the window of the plane, and said to his friend, "Look at those people down there. They look as small as ants, don't they?"
　　"Those are ants," answered his friend. "We're still on the ground."A Nail Or A Fly?
　　An old gentleman whose eyesight was failing came to stay in a hotel room with a bottle of wine in each hand. On the wall there was a fly which he took for a nail. So the moment he hung them on, the bottles fell broken and the wine spilt all over the floor. When a waitress discovered what had happened, she showed deep sympathy for him and decided to do him a favour.
　　So the next morning when he was out taking a walk in the roof garden, she hammered a nail exactly where the fly had stayed.
